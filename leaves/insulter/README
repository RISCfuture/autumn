A simple Autumn Leaf that generates faux-Shakespearean insults. This leaf
required no database and no additional gems beyond that of a normal Autumn
install.

== Usage

!insult [name]:: The bot lets fly a barbarous insult against [name], whose very
                 spirit will thenceforth be crushed into a negligible pulp.
